# Unity-Paint-Tool

Placing large quantities of prefabs in a game level can be very time consuming.
This tool combines the speed and convenience of a photoshop-style brush tool with several useful fine-tuning,
grouping and randomization features to make decorating your levels a snap and save you lots of time.


You simply Drag & Drop your prefabs into the Tool editor window. Based on the settings you choose through the user friendly interface, the tool draws from the prefab list and "paints" objects into the scene with a click and drag of the cursor. You can paint, erase, and use a precise individual placement mode, toggling between these functions with simple keyboard shortcuts.

Have Fun!
